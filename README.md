# nosql-challenge

I ensured that mongodb was loaded correctly on my machine and then proceeded to set up the dataset. Loading in the db, and ensuring that everything was pulling in correctly. I then added the Penang Flavours information all through terminal. I added the code that I used in Mongodb shell, I hope that was the correct move. For the analysis side I primarily used Jupyter notebook, while checking my work with mongodb shell throughout the process. I will lose points on this assignement because I was not able to figure out how to change my latitude and longitude from a string to a decimal. I used update many, set, and even attempted to parse to a float to convert the information. I used geocode.latitude, to ensure that I was using the parent and the sub class to try and pull the information out. Since I did not succeed in that portion, the part of my analysis around the Penang Flavours will be incomplete. However, I did add the code that I would have used in MongoDb shell to show how to go about it. I used peers, tutor, chat gpt and stack overflow to complete this assignment.
